Authentication\n \n## Problem Statement\nOur users are increasingly concerned about account security. We&#x27;ve seen a 15% increase in support tickets related to account breaches in Q3 2024. Industry standards now expect 2FA as a baseline security feature.\n \n## Proposed Solution\nImplement Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) authentication as an optional security feature for all user accounts.\n \n### Key Features\n- **QR Code Setup**: Simple scanning flow for mobile authenticator apps\n- **Backup Codes**: 10 single-use recovery codes for account access\n- **Remember Device**: Optional 30-day trusted device cookies\n- **Graceful Degradation**: SMS fallback for users without authenticator apps\n \n## Implementation Details\n \n### Backend Changes\n```typescript\n// New auth service methods\ninterface AuthService {\n  generateTOTPSecret(userId: string): TOTPSecret;\n  verifyTOTP(userId: string, token: string): boolean;\n  generateBackupCodes(userId: string): string[];\n}\n","title":"1.
