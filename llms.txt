## Docs

- [GAIT: Agent-Native Source Control Management System](/GAIT_PRODUCT_SPEC): GAIT (Git-Adjacent Intent Tracking) is a revolutionary source control management system designed for the era of agentic engineering and multi-role collaboration. Unlike traditional VCS that focuses on line-by-line changes, GAIT treats intent, plans, experiments, and product operations as first-class citizens alongside code.
- [Agents & Registry](/agents): Agents capture reusable AI personas that can be invoked from the CLI, terminal sessions, and the autonomous job scheduler. Each agent is backed by a markdown document in `.nut/agents/` with YAML frontmatter describing its capabilities, color, and the MCP servers (tools) it can access.
- [API Reference](/api): Complete reference for all Coconut API endpoints. All endpoints follow RESTful conventions and return JSON responses with consistent error handling.
- [Authentication](/authentication): Coconut includes an optional, file-based authentication system for team deployments. Authentication is **disabled by default** and completely opt-in.
- [CLI (aka ](/cli): From the root of your project where you want to setup your `.nut`.
- [Contributing](/contributing): For local development with hot reload across all packages:
- [Devcontainer Setup](/devcontainers): [Devcontainers](https://containers.dev) are a feature of VS Code, Cursor, and other supported IDEs that enable you to create a consistent and secure development environment using containers. They run in an isolated environment, making them particularly well-suited for coding agents and AI-powered development tools such as [Claude Code](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code), Google [Gemini CLI](https://cloud.google.com/gemini/docs/codeassist/gemini-cli), or OpenAI's [Codex](https://github.com/openai/codex).
- [Getting started](/getting-started): Node.js 18+
- [Git Management](/git-management): Coconut provides comprehensive git operations through an integrated UI and API, enabling you to manage branches, commits, worktrees, and remote synchronization without leaving your development environment.
- [LLM Setup](/llm-setup): Coconut includes an AIAssistant that requires API keys from supported providers. Configure them globally after installation:
- [MCP Tools](/mcp): The AI Assistant can call MCP tools during a chat to perform actions such as listing and creating Change Proposals. This page summarizes whatâ€™s available and how to use it.
- [Models](/models): ChatGPT 4o
- [Schedule Autonomous Jobs](/scheduler): Coconut ships with a file-first job scheduler that can run Claude, Gemini, or Code CLI agents on an automated cadence. Jobs live in `.nut/jobs/`, so they version with the rest of your project.
- [Symlinks](/symlinks): Symlinks allow you to present paths from your project's `.nut` to other areas of either the project or filesystem to allow them to be picked up by IDEs or coding agents.
